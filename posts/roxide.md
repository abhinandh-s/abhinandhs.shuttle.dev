snippet: A lightweight, high-performance alternative to the traditional rm command, written in rust.
---

`roxide` is a lightweight, high-performance alternative to the traditional `rm`
command, designed with an emphasis on speed and data preservation. Unlike
standard rm, which permanently deletes files, roxide safely moves them to a
designated "`trash`" directory. This approach enables efficient and fast file
removal without risking unintended data loss.

**Note**: I am an amateur Rust programmer, so while this code might not be the
most refined, it prioritizes safety and has been thoroughly tested. If you have
ideas for improvement or notice any issues, contributions are very welcome! This
project is open to suggestions, code reviews, and pull requests from developers
of all experience levels.

## Getting started

- `roxide file.txt`: files will moved to `trash dir`. ie,
  $HOME/.local/share/Trash/files/
- `roxide revert` : restores perviously removed file/directory to its pervious
  path
- `roxide -r | --recursive` : Remove directories and their contents recursively
- `roxide -f | --force` : Remove without moving to trash directory
- `roxide -v | --verbose` : will print the file name and its out path
- `roxide some/dir/ -p .pdf`: will remove files matching the pattern from
  some/dir
- `roxide some/dir/ -rp .pdf`: will recursively remove files matching the
  pattern from some/dir
- `roxide some/dir/ -rp .pdf -l`: will list files, like dry run
- `roxide some/* -i never`: will never prompt
- `roxide some/* -i once`: Prompt once before removing more than three files or
  when removing recursivly
- `roxide some/* -i always`: Prompt before every removal
- `roxide some/* -p .pdf -i always`: Prompt before every removal

> [!WARNING]
>
> 1. Do not use sudo. Support for sudo is still work in progress.
> 2. It wont warn about write protected contents (wip)
> 3. It is not possible to bring back files removed using patterns with `revert`
>    flag but you can still access it from Trash dir

## Installation

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhi-xyz/roxide.git --depth=1 
cd roxide
cargo build --release
cp target/release/roxide /usr/local/bin/
```

### cargo

```bash
cargo install roxide
```

### Nixos

Add `roxide` as a flake input: In your flake.nix file, add the roxide input
pointing to its GitHub repository.

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs";
    roxide = {
      url = "github:abhi-xyz/roxide";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs"; # Follows the nixpkgs input
    };
  };

  outputs = { self, roxide, nixpkgs, ... }@inputs:
  {
    # Your NixOS configuration or other settings
  };
}
```

Include roxide in NixOS configuration: In the outputs section, set up
nixosConfigurations and add roxide as a module to enable it within your system
configuration.

```nix
{
  outputs = { self, roxide, nixpkgs, ... }@inputs:
  {
    nixosConfigurations."my-nixos-host" = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      specialArgs = { inherit inputs; };
      modules = [
        ./hosts/configuration.nix # Main NixOS configuration file
        roxide.nixosModules.roxide      # Enable the "roxide" module from the flake
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

Activate "roxide" in configuration.nix: Within configuration.nix, enable the
"roxide" program:

```nix
{
  # Other configurations...
  
  program.roxide.enable = true; # note: its program not programs
}
```

Apply Configuration: After updating your configuration, apply it with:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
```

## known bugs

- won't warn about git directory
- can't use sudo
- ~~golb pattern isn't working~~
- ~~pattern -flag interfering with other flags~~
- ~~cant remove a directory which is inside a directory~~

## Planned Features

- ~~roxide revert: Restores files from the trash directory to their original
  location.~~
- roxide --gc <TIME_PERIOD>: Performs garbage collection on trashed files,
  automatically clearing files older than a specified period.
- ~~roxide -f: Forces deletion without moving files to the trash directory.~~
- roxide -s: Shreds files for secure deletion.
